# Drone_Racing

This repository contains the ROS code for running the mapping â€“ planning software framework for the Autonomous Drone Racing Using Camera Based State Estimation capstone project. The code is presented in three separate catkin workspaces. 
Catkin_ws_a and Catkin_ws_trr are fully assembled.
Catkin_ws_r will require the user to use the catkin_make command to build it. 
Here is the compressed fully built Catkin_ws_r file https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R-WwLrWupxcx-CK5uR445IeeCpPop_wc

TRR_With_Custom_Map.sh includes all terminal commands to run the program. 

Simulation Instruction Document contains on overview of how to operate the code, installation dependencies, and description of how to modify the output

Once the code is installed, use the videos below to run the program.
